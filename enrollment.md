# Enrollment âœ…

_Last updated January 9, 2023_

For the pilot offering of Econ 148, we're specifically targeting students who:
- Are undergraduates who be interested in data science and economics
- Have taken Data 8 before
- Do not have time conflicts with the class

**As of now, all seats in the class are full. However, we are maintaining a small waitlist. Note that neither the instructor nor the course staffs have control over enrollment.** 

<!-- After you apply, you will hear back from us within 72 hours, letting you know that you're on the waitlist or (possibly) able to enroll immediately. If eventually a seat opens up for you, you will receive a permission code from us that you can enter on CalCentral to enroll. -->

<!-- ~~The class is restricted to undergraduates only. Since one of its goals is to encourage students to take courses like Data 8 afterwards, we are capping the number of seniors (defined as someone graduating anytime in 2021) in the class to 8. **We especially encourage first-year and second-year students to apply**.~~

~~If you fit the above criteria and are interested in the course, please fill out the application linked below. Please direct any questions to the instructor and course staffs.~~ -->
