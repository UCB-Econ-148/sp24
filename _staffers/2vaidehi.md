Hi! I’m Vaidehi, a junior studying economics and data science. I really enjoyed taking DATA 88E in spring 2021 and hope you enjoy it as well! This semester, I’m looking forward to helping students as a Connector Assistant. Feel free to reach out to me about any doubts you have or tips for doing well in the class.
