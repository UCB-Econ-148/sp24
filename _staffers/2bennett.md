Hi! I'm Bennett Somerville, a second year intending to major in cognitive science with a minor in computer science. I'm interested in applying data science to lots of areas of study, such as public policy, urban planning, and of course, economics. Outside of academics some of my hobbies include working on bikes, cycling, advocating for better urban planning, exploring the outdoors, and playing music (piano & t. sax, mostly jazz).
