Huhey! I’m Peter, a senior double-majoring in Data Science and Environmental Economics and Policy. I’m passionate about finding new solution for a more sustainable future and international poverty alleviation and would love to pursue a P.hD in the future. I spend my free time hiking, climbing, skiing, and reading books that humble me as often as I can.
